# Adaptive Forex Trading Strategy

This project implements a comprehensive, adaptive Forex trading strategy that automatically selects appropriate trading approaches based on current market conditions. The strategy dynamically adjusts to trending, ranging, or volatile markets while integrating advanced risk management techniques.

## Features

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- Analyzes market data across multiple timeframes (1H, 4H, D)

- Identifies suitable entries on smaller timeframes

### Market Regime Detection
- Automatically identifies market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile)
- Applies different trading strategies for each regime:
  - Trend following for trending markets
  - Mean reversion for ranging markets
  - Volatility-based approaches for volatile conditions

### Advanced Technical Indicators
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Bollinger Bands
- ATR (Average True Range)
- Stochastic Oscillator
- Ichimoku Cloud
- Divergence detection
- Support and resistance levels

### Risk Management
- Position sizing based on account risk percentage
- Adjustable risk-per-trade and daily risk limits
- Dynamic stop loss and take profit placement
- Correlation-based position filtering
- Pyramiding for strong trend continuation
- Trailing stops for profit maximization

### Market Analysis
- Trend strength and direction assessment
- Correlation calculation between instruments
- Market structure analysis
- News event filtering
- Sentiment analysis integration
- Trading session optimization
- Enhanced order flow analysis for institutional activity detection
- Volume profile analysis with institutional supply/demand zones

### Execution Features
- Signal strength quantification
- Entry, exit, and position adjustment logic
- Performance tracking and metrics
- Parameter optimization capabilities

## How It Works

1. **Market Analysis**: The strategy begins by analyzing market data across multiple timeframes, calculating technical indicators, and determining the current market regime.

2. **Signal Generation**: Based on the market analysis, the strategy generates trading signals with different approaches for trending, ranging, and volatile markets.

3. **Risk Assessment**: Before execution, each signal is evaluated for risk management, including position sizing, correlation risk, and daily risk limits.

4. **Trade Execution**: Trades are executed with precise entry, stop loss, and take profit levels based on market volatility and structure.

5. **Position Management**: Open positions are actively managed with trailing stops, pyramid opportunities, and early exit signals when market conditions change.

6. **Performance Tracking**: The strategy continuously monitors and calculates performance metrics to evaluate its effectiveness.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Seaborn (for enhanced visualizations)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Strategy

#### With Sample Data
From the command line:
```bash
python3 -m src.main
```

#### With Real Historical Data from Yahoo Finance
```bash
python3 run_with_real_data.py
```

#### From within Python:
```python
from src.strategies.adaptive_strategy import AdaptiveStrategy

# To use generated sample data
from src.main import generate_sample_data

# Initialize instruments and timeframes
instruments = ['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY', 'AUDUSD']
timeframes = ['1H', '4H', 'D']

# Generate sample data
market_data = generate_sample_data(instruments, timeframes)

# Or to use real historical data
from src.utils.data_fetcher import fetch_forex_data
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Set date range
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=180)  # 6 months of data

# Fetch real data
market_data = fetch_forex_data(instruments, timeframes, start_date, end_date)

# Initialize the strategy
strategy = AdaptiveStrategy()

# Analyze markets
analysis = strategy.analyze_markets(market_data)

# Generate signals
signals = strategy.generate_signals(analysis)

# Execute signals
actions = strategy.execute_signals(signals, market_data)
```

## Customization

The strategy can be customized through the configuration dictionary, allowing you to adjust:

- Risk parameters
- Technical indicator settings
- Execution preferences
- Filter thresholds
- Advanced features

Example:
```python
config = {
    'risk_per_trade': 0.02,  # 2% of account per trade
    'rsi_period': 21,        # Custom RSI period
    'use_sentiment_analysis': False
}

strategy = AdaptiveStrategy(config)
```

## Extending the Strategy

This framework is designed to be extensible. You can add new:

- Technical indicators
- Market regime detection methods
- Signal generation approaches
- Risk management techniques

## Data Sources

The strategy supports two data sources:

1. **Generated Sample Data (Default)**
   - Simulated price data with configurable parameters
   - Useful for initial testing and development
   - No internet connection required

2. **Real Historical Data (Yahoo Finance)**
   - Real forex market data from Yahoo Finance
   - Supports multiple timeframes (1H, 4H, D)
   - Caches data locally to minimize API calls
   - Supported pairs: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, USD/CHF, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP

## Performance Reports

The system generates comprehensive PDF reports containing:

- Overall performance metrics (win rate, profit factor, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- Equity curve and drawdown analysis
- Distribution of winning and losing trades
- Performance by timeframe analysis
- Market cycle analysis
- Instrument comparison
- Strategy configuration details

Reports are automatically generated when running the strategy and saved to the project directory.

## Institutional Order Flow Analysis

The strategy includes advanced order flow analysis to detect institutional buying and selling pressure:

- Detects absorption, stopping volume, and climax patterns
- Identifies volume delta divergences with price
- Recognizes accumulation and distribution phases
- Monitors delta reversals for potential position changes
- Provides institutional activity confidence scoring
- Visualizes order flow patterns with detailed charts

See the [Order Flow Analysis Documentation](docs/order_flow_analysis.md) for more details.

### Order Flow Performance Improvement

Simulation results show significant performance improvements when trading with order flow analysis:

- **Profit improvement: 167%** over standard technical analysis
- **Win rate increase: 10.96%** (56.16% → 67.12%)
- **Profit factor improvement: 129%** (1.59 → 3.64)
- **Sharpe ratio improvement: 175%** (0.41 → 1.13)

Order flow analysis provides the biggest advantage during:

- **Distribution phases**: 655% improvement
- **Volatile markets**: Turns negative returns positive
- **Downtrend phases**: 83% improvement

These results demonstrate that order flow analysis is particularly valuable in challenging market conditions where detecting institutional activity can provide a significant edge.

## Future Enhancements

- Develop more sophisticated volume profiling with time-weighted analysis

### Technical Improvements

- Fix pandas FutureWarnings by updating Series indexing syntax
- Improve visualization layouts to eliminate tight_layout warnings
- Enhance data fetching with more reliable real-time sources
- Implement parallel processing for multi-instrument analysis

### Feature Additions

- Add support for additional data sources (FXCM, Oanda, etc.)
- Implement real-time trading capabilities with alerts
- Add advanced machine learning for pattern recognition
- Develop a web interface for monitoring institutional activity
- Enhance backtesting with walk-forward analysis
